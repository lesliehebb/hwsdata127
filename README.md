## Part 0:  What is a function?

## Part 1:  

### Slope of a straight line

1. $\frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$

	*Give kids a line on a graph and ask them to find the slope*

2. Relate to a real variable:  
	1. slope of a ski hill:  x = distance, y=height, slope=steepness of hill
	2. if x = time, y=position, slope=speed
	3. if x = time, y=velocity, slope = acceleration
