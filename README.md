## Part 0:  What is a function?

## Part 1:  

### Slope of a straight line

1. $\frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$

	- show positive slope, negative slope and zero slope (flat)
	- Practice: a line on a graph and ask them to find the slope
 	- remmind them of $y = mx + b $
	

2. Relate to a real variable:  
	1. Examples:  
		- slope of a ski hill:  x = distance, y=height, slope=steepness of hill
		- x = number of cookie boxes sold, y = total sales in dollars, slope= price per box of cookies 
                - x = gallons of gas, y = distance a car can travel, slope = gas mileage
	2. Rate examples:  if the x-axis variable is time, we call the slope a rate
	 	- x = time, y=position, slope= rate of change of distance (speed) (miles per hour)
		- x = time, y=velocity, slope = rate of change of speed (acceleration)
		- x = time (minutes), y = number of blinks, slope = rate of blinking
		- x = hours, y = payment in dollars, slope = rate of earnings ($12.50/hr)

### Slope at a single point

	- What if the function is not a straight line, the slope changes, so we need to consider the idea of **slope at a single point**
