## Part 0:  What is a function?

## Part 1:  

### Slope of a straight line

1. $\frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$

	- show positive slope, negative slope and zero slope (flat)
	- Practice: a line on a graph and ask them to find the slope
	

2. Relate to a real variable:  
	1. Examples:  
		- slope of a ski hill:  x = distance, y=height, slope=steepness of hill
		- x = quantity of cookie boxes, y = total cost to buy, slope= cost per box of cookies 
	2. Rate examples:  if the x-axis variable is time, we call the slope a rate
	 	- x = time, y=position, slope= rate of change of distance (speed)
		- x = time, y=velocity, slope = rate of change of speed (acceleration)
		- x = year, y = unemployment percentage, slope = change in unemployment
